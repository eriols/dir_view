dirview (for OS/400) 
---------------------------------------------------

just a simple display file and RPG IV program to get a 5250 view of so called
stream files in an IFS dir, the name of which is passed to the program. <br>

First create the DSPF using CRTDSPF, then compile and link the RPG srvpgm with 
CRTRPGMOD and CRTSRVPGM.<br>
